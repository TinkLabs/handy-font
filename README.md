## how to add new icon
Place your svg file, eg. download.svg under /svg folder, run below command.
After this also remember to add the new generated svg to git. Better use the naming convention(handy-icon-xxxx) for svg before task running
```
gulp
```

(Assuming you have gulp installed globally) if not, use below command
```
npm install
npm install gulp -g
```
(If you don't have npm, check google how to install npm for your OS)
